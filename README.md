#### Getting Started with Rocket League Hub

When you first log in to Rocket League Hub as a new user, you will be prompted to the edit profile screen where you will enter your profile Username and confirm the name and email address retrieved from your google login. Once you're in the site, you can view and edit your own profile or posts, and view all other public facing user profiles and posts, as well as add comments to the posts themselves. It's a fairly simple start to the app right now, but with further development and the future implementation of a front-end website, this app will be able to function as a social hub for fans of the Psyonix game Rocket League
